=head1 Design

This project is primarily/initially a way to see various Perl database tools,
and specifically L<Class::DBIx::DeploymentHandler> in action. From there
people can add stories and actions for more and more useful things needed in
dealing with dataset migration.

=head1 Status

This project is currently in the concept and planning phase. Join the
conversation if you are interested. Wait a while for useful code.
